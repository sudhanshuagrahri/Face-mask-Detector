# Face-mask-Detector
Machine Learning Project made by Sudhanshu, Shivam, Manoj, Harsh, Janak
In this project contrubution made are:
Janak- Dataset Collection
       preprocessing
Harsh- Testing unknown image using this model
       Detecting face in it
       calcuting confidence
       displaying in frame
Shivam-Testing real time video using this model
       Detecting face in it at every instance
       calcuting confidence in evey frame consisting of many frame
       displaying in frame in that video
 Manoj- Made a face detector model's protxt file
        reading the protxt file and weight file
Sudhanshu- Made a caffemodel of face detector (given weight of CNN)
           Partioning dataset of mask detecting model (seeing best case of partion)
           trainning mask detecting model and accquiring accuracy and plotting in graph
